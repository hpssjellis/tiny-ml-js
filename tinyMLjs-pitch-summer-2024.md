# TinyML and Edge AI For everyone

# The Pro's: Low power, inexpensive, specific, private, client side Edge AI. 

# The Problem: The Private companies that make these micrcontrollers change quickly making Education nearly impossible to keep pace

# A Solution: Bring all of it to the web! Open Source, Stable, for everyone

# Already Seeedstudio from China has adopted part of this solution:

# Steps

1. Web Serial connectivity from Microcontroller to Static web page
2. Machine learning training done on the web page
3. Model exported and converted to a method that can be uploaded to a micrcontroller
4. Use the expected method to upload code to the microcontroller
